# Creating a Single Page Application in React

This chapter focuses on the initial steps to create a single page application (SPA) using React

In this chapter, I covered the following topics: 
* Setting up a new React project 
* Structuring a project

## Project Overview

In this chapter, I created a single-page application in React that retrieves data from an API and runs in the browser with Webpack and Babel.

Styling was done using Bootstrap.

The application that I build shows information about the popular TV show Rick and Morty, along with images.

The build time is 1 hour.

### Summary

In this chapter, I've created a single-page application for React from scratch and learned about core React concepts.

This chapter started with me creating a new project with Webpack and Babel.

These libraries help me compile and run my JavaScript and React code in a browser with minimal setup.

Then, we described how to structure a React application, and this structure will be used throughout this learning.

Also, I learned about state management and data fetching using React Hooks and basic styling with Bootstrap. 

The principles that were applied provided me with the basics from which to create React applications from nothing and structure them in a scalable way.

The project in the next chapter will focus on creating reusable React components with more advanced styling. 
This will be available offline, since it will be set up as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).
